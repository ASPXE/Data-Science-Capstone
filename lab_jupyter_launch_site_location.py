# # **Hands-on Lab: Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium**
# 
#%% md
# Estimated time needed: **40** minutes
# 
#%% md
# The launch success rate may depend on many factors such as payload mass, orbit type, and so on. It may also depend on the location and proximities of a launch site, i.e., the initial position of rocket trajectories. Finding an optimal location for building a launch site certainly involves many factors and hopefully we could discover some of the factors by analyzing the existing launch site locations.
# 
#%% md
# In the previous exploratory data analysis labs, you have visualized the SpaceX launch dataset using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` and discovered some preliminary correlations between the launch site and success rates. In this lab, you will be performing more interactive visual analytics using `Folium`.
# 
#%% md
# ## Objectives
# 
#%% md
# This lab contains the following tasks:
# 
# *   **TASK 1:** Mark all launch sites on a map
# *   **TASK 2:** Mark the success/failed launches for each site on the map
# *   **TASK 3:** Calculate the distances between a launch site to its proximities
# 
# After completed the above tasks, you should be able to find some geographical patterns about launch sites.
# 
#%% md
# Let's first import required Python packages for this lab:
# 
#%%
#import piplite
#await piplite.install(['folium'])
#await piplite.install(['pandas'])
#%%
import folium
import pandas as pd
#%%
# Import folium MarkerCluster plugin
from folium.plugins import MarkerCluster
# Import folium MousePosition plugin
from folium.plugins import MousePosition
# Import folium DivIcon plugin
from folium.features import DivIcon
#%% md
# If you need to refresh your memory about folium, you may download and refer to this previous folium lab:

# [Generating Maps with Python](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/v4/DV0101EN-Exercise-Generating-Maps-in-Python.ipynb)
# 
#%%
## Task 1: Mark all launch sites on a map

# Latitude and longitude of United States
united_states = (39.8283, -98.5795)


launch_sites_map = folium.Map(location=united_states, zoom_start=4)
#%%
launch_sites_map
#%%
# Variable with the locations of the launch sites
locations = [
    (28.562302, -80.577356),
    (28.563197, -80.576820),
    (28.573255, -80.646895),
    (34.632834, -120.610745)
]

## Adding markers
for lat, long in locations:
    folium.Marker(location=(lat, long), popup=f"Lat: {lat}, Lon: {long}").add_to(launch_sites_map)
#%%
launch_sites_map
#%% md
# First, let's try to add each site's location on a map using site's latitude and longitude coordinates
# 
#%% md
# The following dataset with the name `spacex_launch_geo.csv` is an augmented dataset with latitude and longitude added for each site.
# 
#%%
import requests
import pandas as pd
import io

URL = 'https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DS0321EN-SkillsNetwork/datasets/spacex_launch_geo.csv'

# Make the GET request to fetch the CSV file
response = requests.get(URL)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Convert the content of the response to a byte stream and read it into a pandas DataFrame
    spacex_csv_file = io.BytesIO(response.content)
    spacex_df = pd.read_csv(spacex_csv_file)
    print(spacex_df.head())  # Optional: print the first few rows of the DataFrame
else:
    print(f"Failed to retrieve the file. Status code: {response.status_code}")

#%% md
# Now, you can take a look at what are the coordinates for each site.
# 
#%%
# Select relevant sub-columns: `Launch Site`, `Lat(Latitude)`, `Long(Longitude)`, `class`
spacex_df = spacex_df[['Launch Site', 'Lat', 'Long', 'class']]
launch_sites_df = spacex_df.groupby(['Launch Site'], as_index=False).first()
launch_sites_df = launch_sites_df[['Launch Site', 'Lat', 'Long']]
launch_sites_df
#%%
launch_sites_df.dtypes
#%% md
# Above coordinates are just plain numbers that can not give you any intuitive insights about where are those launch sites. If you are very good at geography, you can interpret those numbers directly in your mind. If not, that's fine too. Let's visualize those locations by pinning them on a map.
# 
#%% md
# We first need to create a folium `Map` object, with an initial center location to be NASA Johnson Space Center at Houston, Texas.
# 
#%%
# Start location is NASA Johnson Space Center
nasa_coordinate = [29.559684888503615, -95.0830971930759]
site_map = folium.Map(location=nasa_coordinate, zoom_start=10)
#%% md
# We could use `folium.Circle` to add a highlighted circle area with a text label on a specific coordinate. For example,
# 
#%%
# Create a blue circle at NASA Johnson Space Center's coordinate with a popup label showing its name
circle = folium.Circle(nasa_coordinate, radius=1000, color='#d35400', fill=True).add_child(folium.Popup('NASA Johnson Space Center'))
# Create a blue circle at NASA Johnson Space Center's coordinate with a icon showing its name
marker = folium.map.Marker(
    nasa_coordinate,
    # Create an icon as a text label
    icon=DivIcon(
        icon_size=(20,20),
        icon_anchor=(0,0),
        html='<div style="font-size: 12; color:#d35400;"><b>%s</b></div>' % 'NASA JSC',
        )
    )
site_map.add_child(circle)
site_map.add_child(marker)
#%% md
# and you should find a small yellow circle near the city of Houston and you can zoom-in to see a larger circle.
# 
#%% md
# Now, let's add a circle for each launch site in data frame `launch_sites`
# 
#%% md
# *TODO:*  Create and add `folium.Circle` and `folium.Marker` for each launch site on the site map
# 
#%% md
# An example of folium.Circle:
# 
#%% md
# `folium.Circle(coordinate, radius=1000, color='#000000', fill=True).add_child(folium.Popup(...))`
# 
#%% md
# An example of folium.Marker:
# 
#%% md
# `folium.map.Marker(coordinate, icon=DivIcon(icon_size=(20,20),icon_anchor=(0,0), html='<div style="font-size: 12; color:#d35400;"><b>%s</b></div>' % 'label', ))`
# 
#%%
# Initial the map
site_map = folium.Map(location=nasa_coordinate, zoom_start=5)
# For each launch site, add a Circle object based on its coordinate (Lat, Long) values. In addition, add Launch site name as a popup label

#%% md
# The generated map with marked launch sites should look similar to the following:
# 
#%% md
# <center>
#     <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DS0321EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/module_3/images/launch_site_markers.png">
# </center>
# 
#%% md
# Now, you can explore the map by zoom-in/out the marked areas
# , and try to answer the following questions:
# 
# *   Are all launch sites in proximity to the Equator line?
# *   Are all launch sites in very close proximity to the coast?
# 
# Also please try to explain your findings.
# 
#%%
# Task 2: Mark the success/failed launches for each site on the map
spacex_df
#%% md
# Next, let's try to enhance the map by adding the launch outcomes for each site, and see which sites have high success rates.
# Recall that data frame spacex_df has detailed launch records, and the `class` column indicates if this launch was successful or not
# 
#%%
spacex_df.tail(10)
#%% md
# Next, let's create markers for all launch records.
# If a launch was successful `(class=1)`, then we use a green marker and if a launch was failed, we use a red marker `(class=0)`
# 
#%% md
# Note that a launch only happens in one of the four launch sites, which means many launch records will have the exact same coordinate. Marker clusters can be a good way to simplify a map containing many markers having the same coordinate.
# 
#%% md
# Let's first create a `MarkerCluster` object
# 
#%%
marker_cluster = MarkerCluster()

#%% md
# *TODO:* Create a new column in `spacex_df` dataframe called `marker_color` to store the marker colors based on the `class` value
# 
#%%

# Apply a function to check the value of `class` column
# If class=1, marker_color value will be green
# If class=0, marker_color value will be red
#%% md
# *TODO:* For each launch result in `spacex_df` data frame, add a `folium.Marker` to `marker_cluster`
# 
#%%
# Add marker_cluster to current site_map
site_map.add_child(marker_cluster)

# for each row in spacex_df data frame
# create a Marker object with its coordinate
# and customize the Marker's icon property to indicate if this launch was successed or failed, 
# e.g., icon=folium.Icon(color='white', icon_color=row['marker_color']
for index, record in spacex_df.iterrows():
    # TODO: Create and add a Marker cluster to the site map
    # marker = folium.Marker(...)
    marker_cluster.add_child(marker)

site_map
#%% md
# Your updated map may look like the following screenshots:

# 
#%% md
# From the color-labeled markers in marker clusters, you should be able to easily identify which launch sites have relatively high success rates.
# 
#%%
# TASK 3: Calculate the distances between a launch site to its proximities

#%% md
# Next, we need to explore and analyze the proximities of launch sites.
# 
#%% md
# Let's first add a `MousePosition` on the map to get coordinate for a mouse over a point on the map. As such, while you are exploring the map, you can easily find the coordinates of any points of interests (such as railway)
# 
#%%
# Add Mouse Position to get the coordinate (Lat, Long) for a mouse over on the map
formatter = "function(num) {return L.Util.formatNum(num, 5);};"
mouse_position = MousePosition(
    position='topright',
    separator=' Long: ',
    empty_string='NaN',
    lng_first=False,
    num_digits=20,
    prefix='Lat:',
    lat_formatter=formatter,
    lng_formatter=formatter,
)

site_map.add_child(mouse_position)
site_map
#%% md
# Now zoom in to a launch site and explore its proximity to see if you can easily find any railway, highway, coastline, etc. Move your mouse to these points and mark down their coordinates (shown on the top-left) in order to the distance to the launch site.

    return distance
#%% md
# *TODO:* Mark down a point on the closest coastline using MousePosition and calculate the distance between the coastline point and the launch site.
# 
#%%
# find coordinate of the closet coastline
# e.g.,: Lat: 28.56367  Lon: -80.57163
# distance_coastline = calculate_distance(launch_site_lat, launch_site_lon, coastline_lat, coastline_lon)

#        )
#    )
#%% md
# *TODO:* Draw a `PolyLine` between a launch site to the selected coastline point
# 
#%%
# Create a `folium.PolyLine` object using the coastline coordinates and launch site coordinate
# lines=folium.PolyLine(locations=coordinates, weight=1)

# *TODO:* Similarly, you can draw a line betwee a launch site to its closest city, railway, highway, etc. You need to use `MousePosition` to find the their coordinates on the map first

# 
#%%
# Create a marker with distance to a closest city, railway, highway, etc.
# Draw a line between the marker to the launch site

#%%

#%% md
# After you plot distance lines to the proximities, you can answer the following questions easily:
# 
# *   Are launch sites in close proximity to railways?
# *   Are launch sites in close proximity to highways?
# *   Are launch sites in close proximity to coastline?
# *   Do launch sites keep certain distance away from cities?
# 
# Also please try to explain your findings.
# 
#%% md
# # Next Steps:
# 
# Now you have discovered many interesting insights related to the launch sites' location using folium, in a very interactive way. Next, you will need to build a dashboard using Ploty Dash on detailed launch records.
